## Features

### CRUD Operations Integration

The system seamlessly integrates Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations to efficiently manage gym-related data. This allows for the effective handling of member information, schedules, and other critical aspects of gym management.

### Database

Microsoft SQL Server 2019 is employed as the database application, enabling robust functionality in line with the CRUD operations. The database serves as the backbone for storing and retrieving crucial data.

### Development Methodology

The project team has chosen the Waterfall methodology for the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The methodology involves distinct stages, starting with planning and documentation. During this phase, blueprints for the proposed system are created, including the design of the database and other essential components.

### Graphical Design

Adobe Photoshop is utilized for the graphical design of the software, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The design process aims to enhance the overall user experience and accessibility.

## System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Waterfall methodology is adopted for the SDLC. The stages include:

1. **Planning and Documentation:**
   - Documenting the requirements and creating blueprints for the proposed system.

2. **Design:**
   - Developing the system, including the design of the database and other crucial components.

3. **Development:**
   - Constructing the system based on the designed specifications.

4. **Testing:**
   - Rigorous testing is conducted to ensure the system's reliability and functionality.

## Conclusion

The Advanced Gym Management System represents a collaborative effort to address specific challenges faced by the company. Utilizing C# in Visual Studio 2019 Community, along with Microsoft SQL Server 2019 for the database, this system integrates CRUD operations for efficient data management. The adoption of the Waterfall methodology in the SDLC ensures a systematic and thorough approach to development. The inclusion of Adobe Photoshop in the development process underscores the commitment to a visually appealing and user-centric design.
